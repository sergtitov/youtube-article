"Where Is Your Mind?" by Vsauce

# Intro

Imagine a world where your mind isn't confined to the wet, fatty mass inside your skull. Instead, it extends into your phone, your notes, and even the people around you. This is the intriguing premise Michael from Vsauce explores in his video "Where Is Your Mind?" He delves into the nature of the mind, the power of reason, and the challenges posed by our rapidly evolving society. Through a blend of philosophy, science, and thought-provoking questions, Michael invites us to reconsider what it means to think, reason, and collaborate in an increasingly complex world.

# ELI5

Think of your mind like a big, magical library. Your brain is the librarian, but it doesn't work alone. It uses tools like phones, notes, and even other people to help remember things and solve problems. Just like how you might ask a friend for help with homework, your brain asks other brains for help too. This teamwork makes our minds super powerful, but it also means we have to be careful about how we use this power, especially when it comes to big problems like climate change.

# Terminologies

- **Mind**: The collective system of thoughts, memories, and problem-solving abilities, extending beyond the brain to include tools and other people.
- **Reason**: The process of making inferences and decisions based on facts and logic.
- **Behavioral Inertia**: The tendency to continue doing what one has always done, resisting change.
- **Hyperobject**: A concept introduced by philosopher Timothy Morton, referring to things that are massively distributed in time and space and affect everything they touch, like climate change.
- **Confirmation Bias**: The tendency to search for, interpret, and remember information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs.
- **Wisdom of the Crowds**: The phenomenon where the collective judgment of a group of people is often more accurate than that of a single individual.
- **Lotocracy**: A form of government where decisions are made by people chosen at random, rather than elected officials.

# Summary

## The Mind Beyond the Brain

Michael begins by challenging the conventional notion that the mind is solely housed within the brain. He argues that our minds extend into the tools we use and the people we interact with. This extended mind concept is crucial in understanding how we solve problems and make decisions. Our brains, though remarkable, are just lumps of fat and protein. It's the connections and communications with the external world that truly expand our cognitive abilities.

## The Power and Limits of Reason

Reason, Michael explains, is a powerful tool that has allowed humanity to achieve incredible feats, from increasing life expectancy to building complex societies. However, he also highlights the limitations of reason, especially when faced with hyperobjects like climate change. These are problems so vast and interconnected that they challenge our traditional ways of thinking and reasoning.

## Behavioral Inertia and Its Consequences

One of the key obstacles to addressing hyperobjects is behavioral inertia. This is our natural tendency to stick with the status quo, which can slow down necessary innovation and adaptation. Michael points out that while this inertia can help preserve useful traditions and prevent hasty decisions, it also makes it difficult to respond to long-term, abstract threats like climate change.

## The Role of Intuition and Social Reasoning

Michael delves into the role of intuition in our decision-making processes. Often, our brains make quick judgments without us being fully aware of the underlying reasons. This can lead to biases and errors, but it also highlights the social nature of reasoning. We use reasons not just to make decisions, but to justify them to others and coordinate collective actions.

## The Wisdom of the Crowds

The concept of the wisdom of the crowds is introduced as a way to harness collective intelligence. By pooling together diverse perspectives, we can arrive at more accurate and balanced conclusions. This is contrasted with the current trend of isolated reasoning, where individuals or small groups make decisions without broader input.

## The Future of Reason

Michael suggests that the future of reason may lie in returning to its social roots. He explores ideas like National Deliberation Days and lotocracy, where random citizens are chosen to deliberate on important issues. These approaches could help ensure that a wider range of perspectives is considered, leading to more robust and democratic decision-making processes.

# Takeaways

- **Extend Your Mind**: Use tools and collaborate with others to enhance your cognitive abilities.
- **Challenge Behavioral Inertia**: Be open to change and innovation, especially when addressing long-term problems.
- **Embrace Social Reasoning**: Engage in discussions and deliberations to refine your ideas and decisions.
- **Harness Collective Intelligence**: Value diverse perspectives and the wisdom of the crowds in decision-making.
- **Consider New Governance Models**: Explore innovative approaches like lotocracy to ensure more democratic and inclusive decision-making.

## Introduction

Hey, Vsauce, Michael here. Where is your mind? Is it in your head? I mean, that's where your brain is and your brain helps you remember and plan and make judgments and solve problems. But you also remember and plan with phones and notes and calendars and you make judgments and solve problems with all sorts of things. You know, when you think about it, the brain is really just a wet lump of fat and protein, no firmer than a blob of tofu. But the mind is huge. It's an ever-expanding organ of tissue and wood and stone and steel and people because of communication. Communication allows us to even make other people extensions of our minds. We can access their memories and perceptions and knowledge by simply asking. Or not. I don't need to learn how to fix a car and practice medicine and vulcanize rubber or remember everything. Other people are doing that for me just as I do things for them. We are a species of individuals that is also one big interdependent lumbering growth, a frantic blur of flesh and concrete, a techno-sapien powered by imaginations and passions made real by a hallowed faculty we call reason.

## The Role of Reason

Reason, it is said, guides us to truer knowledge and better decisions. It's allowed us to increase life expectancy, suffer less, work together better, and it's bound to take us further and higher until the end of time. Or is it? The organ we use to reason takes millions of years to evolve, but the fruits of reason grow rapidly and are ever-accelerating. Over the next four decades, we are expected to build the equivalent of another New York City every month. And more concrete was installed in the last two decades outside the United States than the U.S. installed during the entire 20th century. This growth means that quality of life around the world is rising. It means that electricity, manufactured goods, food, comfort, and transportation are all becoming more common and accessible. But there are hints that reason and logic are struggling against the complexity of it all, against our growing dependence on the things we've built and their unintended consequences.

## The Challenge of Hyperobjects

Nearly every part of life as we know it today involves or relies on a process that releases molecules with lopsided electrical charges. This property causes them to absorb and re-emit thermal radiation, pinging it around so that it escapes into space more slowly. Having more warmer parcels of air means stronger weather events. They can't be pinned to any particular extreme storm, but they make extreme storms in general more extreme and frequent. What's at stake isn't just bad weather, it's disaster. It's more lives lost, more property lost. It's more droughts, more hunger, more famine, more people needing refuge, and an even greater reliance on the very things that caused the problem in the first place. In total, we release about 51 billion tons of such gases every year, and we need to release zero. But how do you rethink everything? Who gets to direct the costs and trade-offs? How do you achieve collaboration between nearly every local and national government when what works in one place won't work everywhere? When decisions affect jobs in one place and food in another? When not just things need to be rethought, but also habits and traditions and values? How do you achieve consensus when a problem isn't obvious to the senses, is far away in space and time, requires solutions that affect people in different ways, and, as a product of science, always carries some uncertainty? The philosopher Timothy Morton calls something so massively distributed in time and space, and so viscous, so sticky that it adheres to all that touch it, a hyperobject. Every civilization that grows at the speed of reason must at some point face hyperobjects. In fact, the fact that we still haven't found evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth has been brought up as evidence that some sort of great filter might exist that few civilizations manage to get past. That a hyperobject, like our impact on the planet, might be such a great filter is not a new idea. What it might take to solve it is the topic of Bill Gates' How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. And I decided to do this video in partnership with him and his team because the way we deal with hyperobjects reveals a lot about the mind.

## Behavioral Inertia

It's easy and common to think that we would all be better off if everyone was just more rational, right? But what if reasoning wasn't built for what we've become? Let's begin by looking at behavioral inertia. Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keep doing what you're already doing, status quo bias. It can be a frustrating bias if you desire change, but its origin isn't a flaw. If an organism has managed to survive long enough to reproduce and provide and care for its offspring, then the state of its world was sufficient for its genes to spread. That's all it takes to persist. The types of organisms we see around us will naturally be those that managed to persist and didn't, after reaching that point, rock the boat too much. So behavioral inertia can help slow down the accumulation of unintended consequences and the loss of ideas that work, but it can also slow down innovation and adaptation. If the environmental impacts of our society were more immediate and unignorable, it wouldn't be so tempting to apply this inertial break. But emissions are invisible and their consequences aren't immediate or local. They impact future people and people far away, those who are different from us, poorer than us, people we will never meet. This may be one of the first challenges advancing civilizations face, wielding not just the power of technology and distributed cognition, but also the responsibilities. Extending the mind is really cool, but whether or not a species can extend their empathy might be a great filter. Surely, reasoning will allow us to do that, right?

## The Nature of Reasoning

Well, what is reasoning? Well, reasoning is a way of making inferences. An inference is a piece of new information extracted from the information you already have. We make inferences all the time. Every living thing does. For example, we don't have measuring tape tentacles that shoot from our eyes. And what actually enters our brain is just a 2D image, but nonetheless, our brains can infer depth by attending to cues like stereopsis, occultation, perspective, parallax, size. When this happens, we accept it as reality. We aren't aware of the visual processing that made it possible, and we don't have to be. If, however, we do consciously consider why a certain conclusion was reached, well, then boom, that's reasoning. Reasoning is the process of making inferences, not automatically and instinctively, but by looking at facts and seeing what conclusions they support. When Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth to within a percentage or two of the value accepted today, he didn't do it by measuring the Earth and he didn't just perceive it as self-evident. No, he inferred it from what he knew about shadows and how long it took camels to move. Stories like that make it easy to believe that reasoning evolved because it supercharged our cognitive abilities. I mean, it clearly moves us towards truer conclusions, better decisions, and knowledge no other species could infer. Attempts to describe the rules of good, orderly reason became logic and mathematics, concepts so general and abstract that while we were still animals, armed with them, we were no longer beasts. But that's the rub, isn't it? If reasoning is so great, why are we the only species with such a sophisticated grasp of it? And if its purpose is truth and good judgment, why don't we all agree on everything? It's tempting to think that disagreements happen because, well, I am being rational, but those who disagree with me are being irrational. If only people would just use logic and reason. What's happened to the world? Well, that's a fair complaint if you're arguing over logic puzzles, but the world is not a logic puzzle.

## The Limits of Logic

This, however, is one. Paul is looking at Mary. Mary is looking at Peter. Paul is married. Peter is unmarried. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person? Yes? No? Or not enough information to decide? Think about it. The answer is yes. You may have thought there's no way to know because we don't know if Mary is married. But look, she either is or she isn't. And if she is, well then she, a married person, is looking at Peter, an unmarried person. If she isn't, then Paul, a married person, is looking at her, an unmarried person. So no matter what Mary's deal is, the answer will be yes. When people get this puzzle wrong and the correct answer is explained to them, they almost always immediately see why it's right and change their mind. Life is not always like that. Let's take a look at a logical syllogism. All elephants are awesome. Michael is an elephant. Therefore Michael is awesome. The conclusion is logically valid. It follows from the assumptions. But are the assumptions true? No. I am not an elephant. Also, this premise is subjective. I mean, what does it mean to be awesome? Can we measure it with an ossimometer? So you can see why when analyzing something like our impact on the planet, logic can only be a partial tool. If some people have more to lose than others, who gets to decide which assumptions are fair? Still, though, it would seem that reasoning should be able to help here. If each of us would just attend only to the facts, surely we'd all recognize the same reasonable approach. Problem is, that's not how reasoning works.

## The Flaws in Human Reasoning

Since the scientific study of human reasoning began about a hundred years ago, it has been found again and again that not only are we bad at reasoning, lazy and biased, but we actually seem almost programmed to be bad. Like the flaws are intentional. In an episode of Mind Field, I once used a magician to pull off a little experiment. He asked people to look at two faces and choose which of the two they would prefer to work with, placing their preferences in one pile and those they rejected into another. Then, the pile of people they picked were shown again, and each person was asked to provide a reason for why they chose that person. But with a little sleight of hand, the magician managed to sneak in some of the faces they had just rejected. Amazingly, the majority of people didn't even notice the trick. Not only that, they were able to effortlessly explain the reasons behind their choice. A choice they never actually made. Remembering faces you've only seen briefly isn't the easiest thing to do, but other studies have shown that even if the task involves answering questions about one's political beliefs, things we would seemingly have a firmer grasp on, nearly half of participants will fail to notice that the answers they gave have been reversed when they're later asked to explain them. Point is, we seem practically built to give reasons for whatever we think we must, and not the reasons we actually used to reach a conclusion. What if we don't even use reasons to reach conclusions?

## The Role of Intuition

Well, let's talk about intuitions. Our brains have evolved over millions of years to react to the world around us in brilliant ways with little to no input from us. For example, when you notice that someone is upset, you don't consciously think, hmm, okay, so, uh, well their eyebrows are kind of in that position and their speech seems curt, their posture is... These are all reasons to conclude that they are upset. No. Instead, the belief that they may be upset was just apparent. You intuited it. You know it without exactly knowing how you came to know it. The mood-recognizing parts of your brain operate in a way that is opaque to your awareness. But if someone asks you, why do you think they're upset, you can nonetheless produce all sorts of reasons. Some may have actually been the ones your brain attended to, but they're all just guesses. Instead of using reasoning to come to conclusions, we use conclusions to come to reasons. Now, to be fair, we can go the other way. We love puzzles, and when we don't have a strong intuition either way, we can sit down and mull over various reasons to think one thing or another. Our love of puzzles suggests that reasoning has a survival value. Organisms that found it pleasurable would be more likely to use it. But when we reason alone, even when we have no motivation to reach any particular conclusion, we still exhibit deep biases that seem less like mistakes and more like features. For example, it's been shown that between two otherwise similar products, people will prefer to buy the one with more functions, even if they don't want those functions, never plan to use them, and think they're all pointless and overly complicated. Why? Well, it might be that we find such decisions easier to justify to others. We won't wind up being potentially embarrassed when someone asks why we didn't get the product with more functions.

## The Social Theory of Reasoning

Well, after decades of findings like this, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize that reasoning didn't evolve to help us make better decisions, but instead to help us be social. Intuitions inhabit a cognitive niche on this planet. We aren't strong or sharp or hidden or venomous. Instead, our advantage comes from cognition, reasoning, and cooperation. We can plan hunts, build traps, and engage in coordinated strategies that can be tested and modified on the fly, not by millennia of evolution. Reason allows us to do those things. It's hard to convince people that your intuitions are true, but if you can give reasons for them, it's a whole heck of a lot easier to convince people that you're right. Being able to argue over what the best thing to do is is vital when it comes to coordinating action. Reasons also allow us to justify ourselves in the eyes of others, to explain who we are and express the kinds of reasons we like, what others can expect from us, and what we will likely expect from them. This social theory of reasoning helps explain why two people can earnestly and rationally arrive at two different views. They each have their own unique brain and values and dispositions and experiences, and those are what drove their thinking. The reasons they give may or may not be the real reasons they came to their conclusions, but it's the best anyone can do. The social theory also explains why people tend to give such weak reasons for their beliefs at first, or when their intended audience doesn't need much convincing. It would be a waste of time and cognitive resources to construct grand slam reasons for everything I said and did and thought when it wasn't necessary. Instead, I can offload some of that work to other people. For example, if I say, I want to have lunch at ABC Burgers, well my friend might respond, Nah, no thanks, I had burgers yesterday. And I might reply back, oh, well that's no problem, they also have hot dogs and
