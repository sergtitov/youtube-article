## Summary

The Seiko SNXS, a $100 watch, is beloved for its exceptional value and unique charm, despite its flaws. The new SRPK model offers technical upgrades and improved comfort but lacks the original's quirky appeal.

## Key takeaways

1. The Seiko SNXS is renowned for its exceptional value, offering features like a deep gray sunburst dial and applied Seiko 5 logo for just over $100.
2. Despite its low price, the SNXS has a design reminiscent of the Rolex Datejust, with unique elements like rectangular hour markers and a framed day-date window.
3. The SNXS has a cushion-shaped case that measures 37mm in diameter and 11.5mm in thickness, making it relatively thin but with a bulbous case back.
4. The watch features the 7S26 mechanical movement, which is basic and lacks frills like hacking and hand-winding, but is a workhorse for its price range.
5. The bracelet of the SNXS is its weakest point, being light, slack, and rattly, with folded links and a stamped friction clasp.
6. The new SRPK model, priced at $400, offers significant upgrades, including a more precise case finish, solid end-links on the bracelet, and a 4R36 movement with hacking and hand-winding.
7. The SRPK has a slightly larger case at 37.5mm and a thicker profile at 12.5mm, but its organic shape and gentle curve make it more comfortable on the wrist.
8. The SRPK's dial features a jet black color with faux patina markers, a white chapter ring, and an orange second hand, making it more playful and versatile.
9. The water resistance of the SRPK has been significantly upgraded to 100 meters, compared to the SNXS's 30 meters.
10. Despite the SRPK's technical improvements, the SNXS remains more appealing to some due to its vintage charm and unique character, likened to the appeal of an old record player.
