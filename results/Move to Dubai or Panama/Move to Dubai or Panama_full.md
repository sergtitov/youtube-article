Dubai vs. Panama: A Comprehensive Comparison

# Introduction
Hey everyone, so today we're going to have an interesting discussion about Dubai versus Panama. Because when you go online, you have all these people, these influencers, they're either going Panama, Panama, Panama. Others are going Dubai, Dubai, Dubai. Personally, I have residency here in Panama. I used to live in Oman for a while, so I used to go to Dubai on a regular basis. But Julien here, who has a very large French channel on e-commerce and international has been living here in Panama for a few years. He also lived in Dubai and actually went back and forth between the two. So it was a bit of an emotional roller coaster, right?

# Moving from Panama to Dubai
So you were initially, I think, let's just start this way. You were initially living in Panama, then you got tired of it. And then you were like, I'm off to Dubai. So what was, why did you leave Panama and why did you move to Dubai?

Well, I think the trigger was the fact that COVID measure here were really restrictive. So it was a bit of pain at the end. We've been locked for one year here. It was bad. We were not able to go out of our apartment during one year. We were able to go out like twice a week, depending on the last number of the ID card. So it will be the time slot where you can go out. And a woman could go out three times a week and men only twice. And yeah, it was just boring and not the life I was wishing by staying here in Panama. So it's a little bit of bad luck, let's say, because the previous year were really good. I mean, when I'm doing this video right now, it's six years almost I'm here. Like I'm in my sixth year. I had some great years before COVID and then COVID hit, they became quite crazy here. Like they were really afraid of it. Like if you go in an airport, you know, where's the flight for Panama? They're wearing as much shoes. Like they were really like super afraid of it. So yeah, I just got tired of it. And my brother was moving to Dubai because he has his company and business and employees there. So I wanted to stay next to my brother. So, okay. It convinced me. I was not really like wanting to go to Dubai, but let's try it. So yeah, I arrived. It was Disneyland. Everything was open. Everything was closed here. So like big difference. So in the first like few weeks, few months, it was nice. And at some point it evaporate, like the fun and yeah. I mean, it just...

# The Reality of Living in Dubai
The new gets old. Yeah. Basically after a few months, I just got back to a normal routine. And it's the same as like a hall you can eat buffet. At the beginning you're happy because there is so much to do, blah, blah, blah. After you get back to your normal life, working in your apartment and what matter is like to have like a nice place, nice view, nice friends, like a group of friends and nice restaurants. So yeah, at the end you feel like the premium you're paying for staying in Dubai doesn't worth it compared to staying in Panama.

# Cost of Living Comparison
I think for you were sharing a bit earlier, you were spending, I think $8,000 a month here in Panama versus how much in Dubai? Roughly here, my expense for a month is between six to $8,000 more or less every month. This is what I spend in rents and in eating out and stuff. And to be, I mean, we're here, we are at, we're in a big suite in a five-star hotel. He lives full-time in a five-star hotel. I rent two. Yeah. And he rents two suites. So for himself and his family, and still he's spending only six to $8,000 a month. Yeah. So basically, yeah, maybe closer to $8,000, not to give a wrong expectation. As a single man, yes, five, six, but as the family grow, like, yeah. So compare this to Dubai, Dubai, it's left to be under 15K. Yes. My lifestyle in Dubai for the double of the price is 20% lower. Like I don't have the same view. I don't have the same service, the same quality of service. Yeah. It's just not as good. And so we are comparing the cost of my life for one month, but in fact, the rent only is like three times more expensive. Yeah. Rents in Dubai are crazy. Yeah. Yeah.

# Personal Experiences in Both Cities
So the first time I've been there, so just to give a little bit of context, I did Panama, I did Dubai as a single person. Then I met my wife and then we moved back here in Panama. We enjoy it. We had a great time here. And when summer came, as always, we come back to East Europe, Belorussia. And while I was there, I was close to Dubai. So I say, why not going again there? Give it another chance as a family to see if there is a difference between being single and going there as a family. So Julien is a little bipolar. It hasn't been completely diagnosed yet. Not yet. So yeah, I didn't love it first. I mean, it's a great option, Dubai. I don't want to turn this video in Dubai bashing because I think it's a fantastic option. And I think it can suit a lot of people. Just not for me. That's it. I mean, I can deal with it. I can be there, but I'm just not as happy as when I'm here. Like that's the thing. And I'm spending double, triple. So at some point you just make your calculation and that's it. So yeah, I try as a family there. It's great. There is a lot of theme park, aqua park. I mean, you name it, they have it all. Like it's great, great for family, for fun. But again, the all you can eat syndrome hits again. And yeah, once you've done all the theme park in the first one, two months, okay, well, what else? So yeah, it's coming back to, you have a nice walk down your building, you have some nice restaurant, some nice friend and does it worth paying like-

# Pollution in Dubai
And the pollution. Yeah. Let's come to- That's something no one ever discusses about Dubai. It's true. Like lots of entrepreneur are moving to Dubai. It's great. It's amazing. They never talk about pollution. And I mean, I'm making business, I'm making money to live long and healthy and not to like to die early. So I want to enjoy my life and I feel staying in Dubai is going to be a problem for my health and my family health. So that's also one big point making me going out of Dubai because, I mean, I have a little bit of asthma, so I might be more impact than normal people. But even if you don't have any like respiratory problem, you might still feel like it's not good air. When you breathe full, you don't breathe full. You feel like-

# Education and Schools
And schools? School, they're pretty expensive. They're good. You have some good international schools. So there is some great option. It's a bigger city than here. So obviously they have more options. The price is about like more than the Dubai than here. For the same standard, I'm in American school. In Panama, we have an American school. In Dubai, we had an American school, Canadian school, I mean, English speaking school. And basically you're paying in Dubai maybe 1,200 for half day. Here you pay 580 for full day. Okay, 580 per month for school. And I prefer the accent here. So basically they don't have an accent like you, a real American, I would say, or English like fluent speaker. But it's a little bit better. Obviously, in Dubai, you have Indian Pakistanis staff helpers, and they have this accent. You don't want your child to speak with an Indian accent? No, not really. I mean, it's not the one that- I mean, it's not my favorite. I don't say my accent is great by any means. It's not that good. I need to practice more. Yeah, I prefer the accent here. I mean, it's American accent with a little bit of- you can hear a little bit of Spanish in the background. But it's great accent, so I prefer it. Yeah.

# Banking Systems
What about banking? Banking, I think both are really interesting option. I will say for the strength of the bank, Dubai might win because it's backed by the government. So yeah, I think the bank are pretty solid in Dubai. In Panama, they are quite well managed. It's like- since decade, it's a financial hub. So no problem here. Like all the big ed in the world, they have money here. So if they were not trusting the jurisdiction, they wouldn't put any pens here. But basically, the service in the bank is not as good in Dubai than it is here. Yes. I will say the whole experience in Dubai, you are here as a guest in the country. The visa system, you have to renew every two years, you restart all the process, blah, blah, blah. I mean, you update. It's not as a pain as when you first come, but still, every two years, paper again, paper. And here, once you become resident, I mean, you're resident for life, you become permanent resident, you have to keep your status to come like once every 24 months. But basically here, you can feel at home and you feel at home for banking too. I will explain myself. So when my first Emirate ID, almost at the expiration date, I received a kindly email from my bank in Dubai saying, well, you have one month to update your new Emirate ID. If not, we will lock your account. Yeah. I had exactly the same thing in Oman. So yeah, I don't like this feeling of always being just a guest. Not that I want to mix with the population. I just want to feel home, to feel confidence with the future that I can see long term. And that's not something you can feel in Dubai, unfortunately, for now. I know they are working a lot on it. They were even speaking of giving citizenship, but wait for it. It's not tomorrow. But they are aware of the problem. If they want to have a population that stays, they need to make people feel at home. So I think they, at some point, are going to work on it. Same for air pollution. We were talking about it. They are doing things to improve it. Over the last four years, something like this, they reduced it from a few percent already. It's going to take decades before it becomes like here. Because in comparison, Panama, Dubai, here, it's six or eight times less polluted. Yeah. Big difference. If you go on the website, I don't remember, Air Quality Suisse, something like this, you will see that Panama is most of the time green, which is exceptional for quite a big city. At the end of the day, it's one million people living here, and it's pretty good air quality. Yeah, it's great. Dubai is really at the level, I think, it's just behind some Indian or Chinese. I think it's even worse than some Chinese cities, which are famous for being extremely polluted. So yeah, that's one point.

# Bureaucracy and Regulation
And maybe we can touch a little bit on regulation, the fact that we can say bureaucracy also. I feel it's becoming heavier and heavier in Dubai. And if you never came here in Panama, you don't really know what's freedom, I would say. Maybe there is some other country that would give you this feeling. Yeah, except COVID, of course. But if you're someone who always has been living in the West, I would say you need to come once in a country like this one, and you will understand this feeling, this vibe of freedom that you cannot express through cameras or an interview, but you're left alone. The word is you're left alone. Because no one cares. No one cares. That's the thing. In Dubai, as I say, you always have to renew your ID, your stuff. You're always in touch a little bit. You always ask some papers, some stuff. I will give some random things so you understand. Once, I sold an office chair because I was moving. And I just got down with the office chair in the elevator. And the security guard arrived, said, you need a moving permit for this. You could get a fine, but it's OK for this time. I'm paying $8,000 rent without electricity, internet, and everything. So it cost me a home and a leg. And I'm treated really bad. I didn't like this feeling at all. I never used my card to the access card building. I don't like to have things in my pocket. So basically, I mean, there is concierge. I think we pay service charge for that, for someone to activate the door, to unlock the door. And once in every month or so, the guy decided, and my brother is living in this building since three years, they saw me like, I mean, they see me every day. And once every month, month and a half, they decide they don't recognize me. Are you living here? Your contract? Like, what's the name on the contract? They do like a full check on you, ID, everything. Once it was so bad, I had my wife coming down to open the door for me. $8,000 rent. That's top class service. So yeah, it's some details, but it's just to illustrate how terrible can be your life in small things like this.

# Social Dynamics and Cultural Differences
And the issue... In Dubai, you're always a second tier citizen. Well, not a citizen. You're just a second tier... Guest. Guest. Yeah. Second tier guest. That's the right way of putting it. And the thing is, like all the people in the management team, in the building, in like in restaurant and stuff like this, there are Indians and Pakistanis, and I don't want to do any racism with what I'm going to say right now, but it just, we don't think the same way. We're not wired the same way. And the fact they are the one who are the one who need to make you comply with regulation and stuff, and they get fired super easily. So they are under pressure. So they make sure everything is like to the T, which you don't have here. Like here it's more like... Yeah. It's more flexible. You can talk your way out of situations. If they make your life impossible here, they ask you like a bunch of paper for no matter what, like, I don't know, you want to open a contract or something. Okay. You say that's what you have on your paper. What's the second way? Yeah. And it opens doors all the time. Like there is always a way. And in Dubai, it's missing a bit. There is always a way. There is no way because there is rules. It's strict. But it's why it's working well as well. Like it's clean. It's neat. I mean, it's pristine. Like I was living in Marina. I mean, you can eat on the floor. It's great. You can leave your iPhone, your MacBook. This, you already are eating out. Here you can occasionally fall into the gutters. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here the sidewalk are a bit... Yeah. But the story you heard on YouTube saying like, Oh, I left my iPhone. I left my wallet in a restaurant or something. It's totally true. Like the girlfriend of my brother, she left on the sidewalk or MacBook Air because she was smoking a cigarette. She wanted to light and she started to speak about something else. She forget the MacBook Air for 24 hours. Wow. Yeah. She came back. The MacBook was here. This is insane. In front of our school. The thing is there is so much camera. You stall it. I mean, you take it even if you don't want to steal it. People won't try because they will think, the camera will think they are going to steal it and they might get some trouble. So people just don't touch. Yeah, it's crazy. So the safety is like to the roof. I wouldn't say the safety is bad here. Not at all. It's pretty good if you stay in the city center. Of course, if you go out, if you go in the suburb, in the poor district where you will never go as an expat. But if you go there, yeah, there is some drugs, there is some gangs and stuff like this. But it's not as bad as I would say, maybe Colombia or Mexico. I mean, it's getting better, but I think it's safer here. It's safer. It's safer here. It's not Dubai safe, but for Latin America, it's very safe. It's very safe. I feel extremely safe. I mean, coming from Europe, where violence is everywhere now, like you walk in Paris, you go like two weeks on holidays in Paris, you will see someone getting stalled. You will see someone yelling or insulting you in the street. You will see something like that. You will be in contact with violence within one, two weeks. In more than five years here, I've never seen any scene of violence here. Anything. Not a single one. No, it's pretty good.

# Nature and Activities
Look, at the end of the day, both destinations are very viable destinations. Again, I'll just add that from a nature point of view, though, Dubai has all the deserts and the oasis and there's Oman that's pretty close by. Here, there's more for hiking, swimming, surfing. You're an hour flight away from Costa Rica, from Colombia, all that. So there's a lot. I'd say there's probably a bit more to do here than in Dubai. It depends what you want. Let's say if you want theme park and stuff like this, Dubai is the place. If you want nature, I mean, it has a lot to offer here. Yeah, but Dubai also- Yeah, in Oman and stuff like this, you have some great place too. Yeah, it's both extremely good option. I think it's in the top 10 of the list of the best destination to relocate yourself and reduce your tax at the same time. 

# Summary 
So yeah, I feel confident both destination are extremely good. It just depends on you, what you're willing to pay, how much you need to be in Dubai, because there is some people, they would prefer being in Dubai because it's closer to Europe. Yeah. For Americans, this year makes more sense. Canadians, Panama. Yeah. So it really depends where you need to be. Dubai is a better hub if you want to travel the world, because you go easily in Asia, you go easily in Europe, East Europe. I mean, it's well deserved. Panama is greatly deserved as well, and they built the second airport. I don't know if you saw. Now there is terminal two, so they're ready to get some more tourists and more connecting flight. It's like the main destination for connecting flight. And the company, the local company, by the way, is the one, the most on time in all Latin America, Copairline. Yeah. So yeah, it's still okay to move around, but you maybe have more option in Dubai. Yeah. Cool. I think this gives a, this was an interesting discussion. So if you're interested in moving to Panama, there's a link below with more information on how to move to Panama. There's also an email below. You can contact the gentleman there. If you want to move to Dubai, he'll give you a quote. If you want to create a company, et cetera, to be able to move to Dubai. Generally speaking, it's easier and more affordable to move to Panama. Getting the residency permit is 30% cheaper, and then you get the permanent residency that you don't need to renew after. It's over. After you finish the process in Dubai, you will have always to do it again. So it's like... Panama is a better plan B. Plan A, up to you. Plan B, Panama is always better, essentially. I would say so.
