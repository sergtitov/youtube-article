# Full transcript

Your task is to take in a full video transcript as a text blob and return full unmodified transcript but make it broken up into clearly readable topics and paragraphs depending on the content.

# Details

Use markdown for output.
Follow with the transctipt broken up into sections with each having a section title. 
Each section should be level 2 header like "## Header"
Do not provide the overall title, just sections.
Take into account that the input will be in markdown with screenshots inside the text like this: ![Screenshot](screenshots/screenshot_10.png). You need to preserve them in your output but make sure that they don't break paragraphs.
Make sure to break the text into readable and SHORT paragraphs.
